11th dimension

11th dimension may refer to:


The 11th dimension is a characteristic of spacetime that has been proposed as a possible answer to questions that arise in Superstring Theory, which involves the existence of 9 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time.
Humans can understand only 3 spatial dimensions and one time dimension, and the remaining 6 spatial dimensions are compactified. Some physicists have suggested that there exist 11 dimensions, which are compactified like the six dimensions. 
Michio Kaku, an American theoretical physicist, has said he believes the multiverse of universe is 11-dimensional. In string theory, the multiverse is made of different dimensions but the highest is 11th dimension. Beyond 11 dimensions, the universe would become unstable and dimensions higher than 11 would collapse to an 11-dimensional universe.
